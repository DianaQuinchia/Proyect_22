
Costco Wholesale Corp. reported second-quarter earnings of $394 million, or 90 cents per share, up from $348 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.

As the Puget Sound Business Journal reports, that beat analysts' expectations of 87 cents per share.

Separately, according to retail organization RetailSails, Costco has the highest sales per store of any bricks-and-mortar retailer in the U.S., with $131.4 million in sales per store last year. That figure is nearly twice that of the No. 2 chain on the list, Sam's Club.
